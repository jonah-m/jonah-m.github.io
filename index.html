                    <p>Hello there! My name is Jonah, and I'm a passionate data analyst with a knack for turning raw data into meaningful insights. I have experience working with Python, Google Sheets, Tableau, and SQL, which allows me to harness the power of data and create compelling visualizations.

                        When I'm not diving into datasets or crafting stunning dashboards, you can find me rocking out on the drums or working on my latest CNC woodworking project. I believe that a balanced life is essential, and my hobbies keep me energized and excited to tackle new data challenges.

                <p>This project focused on cleaning Twitter data for analysis. Data was gathered from various sources, including a CSV file provided by Udacity, a TSV file containing animal predictions, and additional data from Twitter's API using Tweepy.

                    The data was converted into a pandas dataframe and assessed both programmatically and visually to identify quality and tidiness issues. After the assessment, the data was cleaned and stored in a new CSV file.
                    
                    The cleaned data was then analyzed, demonstrating that it was ready for more in-depth analysis.</p>

                <p>The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of flight cancellations and delays in the United States. It reveals that weather is the most significant factor contributing to delays, with Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) being the worst-affected in the country. To improve flight punctuality and reduce cancellations, the analysis suggests that airlines and airports should invest in better weather prediction systems, implement more efficient scheduling practices, and enhance communication with passengers during disruptive weather events..</p>
